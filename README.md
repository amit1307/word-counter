# word-counter
A simple library called "WordCounter".  It has the following two distinct methods:
1.	method that allows you to add words
2.	method that returns the count of how many times a given word was added to the word counter

It also has the following features:

-	should NOT allow addition of words with non-alphabetic characters
-	should treat same words written in different languages as the same word, for example if
adding "flower", "flor" (Spanish word for flower) and "blume" (German word for flower) the counting method should return 3.
